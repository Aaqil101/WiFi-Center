    <h1 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>
    <p>This page contains answers to common questions about the Wi-Fi Center application. If you have a question that is
        not answered here, please check the <a href="contributions.html">Contributions</a> page for information on how
        to
        ask for help or report issues.
    </p>

    <h2 id="general-usage">General Usage</h2>
    <p><strong>Q: How do I exit the Wi-Fi Center application?</strong></p>
    <p>A: You can click the standard 'X' button in the window's title bar, press <code>Alt+F4</code>, or type one of the
        exit commands (<code>quit</code>, <code>exit</code>, <code>close</code>, <code>terminate</code>) into the
        command bar and press Enter.</p>

    <p><strong>Q: How do I refresh the list of Wi-Fi networks?</strong></p>
    <p>A: Type <code>-r <strong>|</strong> refresh</code> into the command bar and press Enter. The background scanner
        also updates the list
        automatically at regular intervals.</p>

    <p><strong>Q: How do I connect to a Wi-Fi network?</strong></p>
    <p>A: Select the desired network using the <code>-c &lt;SSID&gt; <strong>|</strong> connect &lt;SSID&gt;</code>
        command. If
        the network is secured, a password dialog will appear for you to enter the required
        credentials.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Q: How do I disconnect from the current Wi-Fi network?</strong></p>
    <p>A: Type <code>-d <strong>|</strong> disconnect</code> into the command bar and press Enter.</p>

    <p><strong>Q: Can I connect to hidden networks (networks that don't broadcast their SSID)?</strong></p>
    <p>A: Currently, the application primarily lists networks detected during scans. Connecting to hidden networks might
        require using the native Windows Wi-Fi manager (accessible via the
        <code>-w <strong>|</strong> wifi-manager</code> command).
    </p>

    <p><strong>Q: How can I see the password I'm typing?</strong></p>
    <p>A: There should be a "Show Password" checkbox or icon next to the password input field that appears when you
        select a secured network.</p>

    <p><strong>Q: Where can I see connection status or error messages?</strong></p>
    <p>A: Check the Output Box located directly below the command bar at the bottom of the window.</p>

    <h2 id="background-scanner-faq">Background Scanner</h2>
    <p><strong>Q: What is the icon in my system tray?</strong></p>
    <p>A: That's the icon for the background Wi-Fi scanner process (<code>core/wifi_scanner.py</code>). It runs
        continuously to provide network data to the main application. See the <a
            href="advanced_features.html#background-scanner">Advanced Topics</a> page for details.</p>

    <p><strong>Q: Why does the scanner run separately?</strong></p>
    <p>A: Running the scanner as a separate background process ensures that network scanning doesn't freeze the main
        application's user interface and allows for continuous updates.</p>

    <p><strong>Q: Can I stop the background scanner?</strong></p>
    <p>A: Yes, right-click the scanner's system tray icon and select "Exit". However, the main Wi-Fi Center application
        will stop receiving network updates if the scanner is not running.</p>

    <p><strong>Q: What information is in the <code>wifi_data.json</code> file?</strong></p>
    <p>A: It contains a JSON list of the top 6 networks detected by the background scanner, including their SSID, signal
        strength, whether login is required, and the last time they were seen. You can view it by right-clicking the
        scanner's tray icon and selecting "View WiFi Data".</p>

    <h2 id="commands-faq">Commands</h2>
    <p><strong>Q: How do I know which commands are available?</strong></p>
    <p>A: You can refer to the <a href="basic_features.html#available-commands">Basic
            Features</a> documentation.</p>

    <p><strong>Q: Why do commands like <code>shutdown</code> or <code>reboot</code> require confirmation?</strong></p>
    <p>A: These are potentially disruptive actions, so the application asks for confirmation to prevent accidental
        system shutdowns or restarts.</p>

    <h2 id="other-faq">Other</h2>
    <p><strong>Q: Where is the settings menu?</strong></p>
    <p>A: Currently, Wi-Fi Center does not have a dedicated settings menu. Configuration is primarily handled through
        files (like stylesheets in the <code>styles/</code> directory).</p>

    <p><strong>Q: How can I contribute to the project?</strong></p>
    <p>A: Please refer to the <a href="contributions.html">Contributions</a> page for guidelines on how to contribute
        code, report bugs, or suggest features.</p>
